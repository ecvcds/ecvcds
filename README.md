- âš¡ Fun fact: During my free time, I enjoy gathering around a table to play board games, running with my French bulldog, reading, battling in Summoners Rift, or planning my next trip.

With a background in Electrical Engineering and a recently earned PhD in Computer Science - Intelligent Systems, I've delved into developing decision support systems for active communities.
My focus was on integrating renewable resources into power and energy systems while ensuring customer privacy and fairness using machine learning algorithms. 
My contributions include over 20 publications and involvement in international and national projects.

Now, my journey leads me to pursue web development, leveraging my academic excellence and practical experience. 
I've completed workshops on front-end development and am eager to apply my skills creatively to solve problems in this domain.
